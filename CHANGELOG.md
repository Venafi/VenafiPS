## 3.1.3
- Add `-Force` parameter to `Revoke-TppToken` and `Revoke-TppCertificate` to bypass confirmation prompt

## 3.1.2
- Add `-EventId` parameter to `Read-TppLog` to filter by a specific event id.

## 3.1.1
- Add -UseBasicParsing to `Invoke-WebRequest` to avoid IE profile error

## 3.1.0
- Add `-CountOnly` to `Find-TppCertificate` to return the number of certificates found based on the filters provided, [#12](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiPS/issues/12)
- Move from `Invoke-RestMethod` to `Invoke-WebRequest` in `Invoke-VenafiRestMethod` so we get response headers, to be used with `-CountOnly` above.  `Invoke-VenafiRestMethod` has a new parameter, `-FullResponse`, to retrieve the complete response, not just content value.
- Add `New-HttpQueryString` private function to support HEAD api calls which require a query string and not body.

## 3.0.2
- Add `Test-ModuleHash` to validate the script files in the module.  The release pipeline has been updated to create a GitHub release with a file which stores the file hashes with SHA256.  This function will validate the current module against these hashes and provide true/false for success or failure.

## 3.0.1
- Fix [#6](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiPS/issues/6), truncation on json conversion.

## 3.0
- Rebrand from VenafiTppPS to VenafiPS as the module will now support Venafi products other than TPP.  Functions with -Tpp in the name will now be TPP only, -Vaas will be for Venafi as a Service only, and -Venafi will be both
- Rename `New-TppSession` to `New-VenafiSession` and add support for Venafi as a Service.  Use the parameter `-VaasKey`
- Rename `Get-TppCertificate` to `Export-VenafiCertificate` and now supports Venafi as a Service.  Alias added so existing scripts don't break.

- Add `Invoke-TppCertificatePush`
- Fix [#130](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiTppPS/issues/130), `Get-TppDevice` only accepting IP address for host, not hostname.  Thanks @Curtmcgirt!
- Fix [#131](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiTppPS/issues/131), add examples to `New-TppCapiApplication`.  Thanks @Curtmcgirt!
- Fix [#132](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiTppPS/issues/132), 500 error setting BindingIpAddress running `New-TppCapiApplication`.    Thanks @Curtmcgirt!
- Fix [#134](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiTppPS/issues/134), server url is blank when running `Get-TppObject` with secondary token.  This was an issue for `Get-TppPermission` as well.  Thanks @stevekeever!
