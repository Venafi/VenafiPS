## 6.11.0
- Add token based authentication to VC with `New-VenafiSession -VcEndpoint` and `New-VcToken`.  If the JWT has not expired, but the access token has, `New-VcToken` supports refresh.
- Caching framework created for many VC objects (and some VDC ones as well).  If a requested item is not found, the cache will try and refresh in case it's been newly created.
- Enhanced tab completion now utilizing the new caching framework.  A lot more objects are now available via tab completion and will also display a description as well.  For example, VSatellite shows the status and version.  Be sure to set your Tab key functionality with `Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete`
- Add many direct filters to `Find-VcLog` and `Find-VcCertificateRequest` so -Filter can be used less (since it's cumbersome).  The other Find functions will get similar treatment in time.  If you have specific filters you'd like to add, please submit an enhancement request
- Add `Find-Vc* -IncludeAny` to OR the direct filters as opposed to AND
- Add `Find-VdcCertificate -Algorithm` to support the new pkix algorithms introduced in v25.1.  Tab completion is available with full descriptions.  `New-VdcCertificate` and other applicable functions will be updated in time
- All current VC regions have been added
- Add support for VC shared credentials with `New-VcMachine -Credential`, `New-VcMachineCommonKeystore -Credential`, and `New-VcMachineIis -Credential`, [#349](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/349)
- Fix `Invoke-VcWorkflow` test connection where the configured size of the socket response was not large enough
- Fix `Invoke-VcCertificateAction` error when the certificate was not issued within the VC timeout
- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew -Wait` to monitor a renewal for passing the requested state


## 6.10.0
- Add support for tags during certificate creation with `New-VcCertificate -Tag`, [#337](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/337)
- Performance enhancement for `ConvertTo-VdcObject` which decreased Windows Powershell runtimes for `Find-VdcObject` and all other functions that use it, [#342](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/342)
- Add `-IsExpired:$false` for both `Find-VdcCertificate` and `Find-VcCertificate` to find all certificates that are not expired
- Add renewal configuration to `Get-VcApplication`
- Fix issue with `Invoke-VcWorkflow` where $VenafiSession was not getting picked up properly
- Ensure only 1 team matches Owner when using `New-VcMachine -Owner` and the value is a name.  This is needed as the product allows multiple teams with the same name.
- Create duplicate objects with `New-VdcObject -SourcePath`.  **Not recommended for certificates**.  [#343](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/343)
- Allow manifests of different formats to be provided to `Set-VcConnector`

- Add unit test for function help and resolve the issues
- Update `Find-VdcVaultId` to retrieve via object path
- Update `Find-VdcVaultId` to output via pipeline by default.  Providing `-OutPath` will remain unchanged.
- New pipeline options from `Find-VdcVaultId` and `Get-VdcCertificate -IncludePreviousVersions` to `Export-VdcVaultObject`, the latter will export all historical certificates
- Add `Export-VdcCertificate -VaultId` for exporting any certificate via vault id.  If exporting historical certificates and would like the associated key, this is the preferred approach.
- Add `Find-VdcObject -Class` when using `-Attribute -Pattern` to filter attribute searches by a specific class/type
- Fix error in `New-VcConnector` causing manifest import to fail

- Add `Get-VenafiSession` to centralize session management.  For nested and/or piped functions, pull the session from the call stack.
- Add _PolicyPath_ to `Export-VdcCertificate` output and `Import-VdcCertificate -PolicyPath`.  This allows the imported certificate to be created in the same policy folder.  This could be used to synchronize across environments for example.  The addition of `Import-VdcCertificate -Force` will cause a policy path to be created if it does not already exist; policy subfolders are supported as well.
- Add `Import-VcCertificate` blocklist functionality.  Override the blocklist by default and honor the blocklist if the environment variable _VC_ENABLE_BLOCKLIST_ is set to true.
- Fix VC import failure with a large number of keystores, [#322](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/322)

## 6.7.1
- Update `New-VcCertificate -IssuingTemplate` to allow an alias to be provided, [#313](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/313).  `-IssuingTemplate` is now also optional if the application only has 1 associated template.
- Add `Set-VcCertificateRequest -RejectReason` to specify a reason for rejection.  The default is 'Rejection processed by VenafiPS'.

## 6.7.0
- Add `Set-VcCertificateRequest` to approve requests.  Optionally, use `-Wait` for the certificate to be issued and certificate details to be available.
- Add `Initialize-PSSodium -Force` to force installation of the module if it doesn't exist.  This is used by the new parameters `Export-VcCertificate -Force`, `Import-VcCertificate -Force`, `New-VcMachine -Force`, `New-VcMachineCommonKeystore -Force`, and `New-VcMachineIis -Force`.
- Update `New-VcCertificate` to retrieve default validity date from the issuing template instead of a set 90 days
- Fix `Find-VdcCertificate -CountOnly` error [#309](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/309)
- Updates to better facilitate moving certificates/keys between environments.

  - Add standard names for Format in return objects in TLSPC and TLSPDC.
  - Add PrivateKeyPasswordCredential in return objects to keep from having to provide again further down the pipeline
- Add `Invoke-VcGraphQL` for queries and mutations.  This isn't used for too much as of now, but the framework is here for when it's needed.
- Update `Get-VcData` to use `Invoke-VcGraphQL` for Application and Team id and names.  Quite often we are just converting names into IDs so graphql should give us a performance bump as opposed to the REST api.
- Deprecated `Add-VcCertificateAssociation`


## 6.6.1
- Fix bogus error during `New-VcMachineCommonKeystore` [#304](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/304)

- Add `Remove-VcSatelliteWorker`, you guessed it...removes vsat workers
- Add `Get-VcSatellite -IncludeWorkers` to get vsats and their associated workers in one call.
- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Provision` to push a certificate to associated machine identities.  You can also use `-Renew -Provision` together and it will renew and then provision the new certificate.
- Add `Set-VcApplication -IssuingTemplate` to add one or more issuing templates to an application.  It will overwrite by default or use `-NoOverwrite` to append.

## 6.5.2
- Add `Set-VcCertificate`.  This replaces `Add-VcCertificateAssociation` to set the applications associated with a certificate.  Certificate tagging is now supported, both add and replace.
- Add support for URL port during TLSPDC token operations, [#305](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/305)

## 6.5.1
- Fix Find-VdcObject documentation page not building, [#302](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/302)
- Rebranding post CyberArk acquisition
- Add specific exception types when working with invalid paths or access issues on VDC objects

## 6.5.0
- Merge all functions into 1 psm1 module.  This yields much better performance, especially when running multithreaded.
- Add multithreading support on PS v5 with the Microsoft.PowerShell.ThreadJob module (installed separately).  If the module isn't installed, multithreading will be disabled.  Set `-ThrottleLimit` to 1 on the functions that support it to disable multithreading on PS v5 and v7.
- Module now available in the GitHub release.  This is helpful for those without access to PowerShell Gallery, although that is the preferred option.
- PSSodium, needed for several TLSPC functions for encryption, is no longer directly included in the module.  Install it from the Gallery.
- The VenafiSession class has been deprecated and replaced with a PSCustomObject equivalent
- Key based authentication on TLSPDC has been deprecated
- Default `Invoke-VdcCertificateAction -Push` to push to all applications and added an example to override and push to specific applications

## 6.4.2

- Add support in `New-VcConnector` for manifests from the simulator and 'full' ones which already have deployment details
- Fix `Add-VcCertificateAssociation` when piping certificate objects, [#284](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/284)
- Fix examples in `Get-VcCertificate` and `Get-VdcCertificate` referencing old parameter names, [#279](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/279)


## 6.3.2
- Add `Get-VdcCredential -IncludeDetail` to provide additional credential information eg. expiration, path to linked certificate, and more
- Add discrete parameters to `Set-VdcCredential` to simplify updating credentials; `-Value` will be deprecated. Add support for updating the Expiration and setting a Credential 'link' to an existing certificate in TLSPDC.

- Add `New-VenafiSession -TimeoutSec`, the default is 0 for no timeout.  If using SecretManagement, store this with the other metadata.
- Add support for `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew -AdditionalParameters`.  The use case was renewing many certificates with a different issuer.
- Update `Set-VdcPermission` to accept just permission switches and not require a permission object.  This assists in setting a permission for the first time for a specific id.

## 6.2.0
- Add support for managing TLSPC Connectors via `Get-VcConnector`, `New-VcConnector`, `Set-VcConnector`, and `Remove-VcConnector`.  The old Connector functions, Get, New, and Remove, which were for managing Webhooks, have been renamed to more appropriately reflect their usage.  They are now `Get-VcWebhook`, `New-VcWebhook`, and `Remove-VcWebhook`.
- Add support for TLSPC EU region with `New-VenafiSession -VcRegion`.  The default is 'us' and accepts 'eu' as well.  This detail will be stored in the resulting session and vault if utilized.
- Update `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew` to retrieve all existing CSR details, [#260](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/260), [#264](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/264).  Also update this function to return any missing/incorrect details when renewing.
- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew -Force` to override the default behavior of stopping when more than 1 common name is encountered.  Use of `-Force` will use the first common name found in the array.
- Update readme to remove deprecated -VaultMetadata parameter, [#256](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/256)

## 6.0.5
- Fix path error when running in parallel on PS Core, [#235](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/235)

## 6.0.4
- Add framework for dynamic tab completion.

  - TLSPDC: currently, the Path variable is enabled. For any Vdc functions with a Path parameter, you can now use tab completion to provide the path. Tabbing without a value will default to '\ved\policy'. Future versions will be aware of the type of item you are looking for and filter appropriately.

  - TLSPC: Application, MachineType, VSatellite, and Certificate have all been enabled. Tab completion will provide a list of names which are much easier to remember than a uuid. All functions with these parameters have been updated to accept an id or name.

  - To see a bash style listing where you can see a full list and select with arrow keys, you can either set your tab key action via `Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete` or use Alt + =.


## 6.0.3
- Fix `New-VenafiSession -VcKey` not storing key as credential and causing Invoke-VenafiRestMethod to fail


## 6.0.2

## 6.0.1
- Update `Export-VdcCertificate` to return just certificate if private key isn't available for supporting formats
- Add support for PKCS #8 in `Import-VcCertificate -Data`, by file will come in a future release


## 6.0.0
This is a major release.  Although every attempt has been made to be backwards compatible, **existing scripts will likely require some updates**.  Please read the full release notes.

- TPP is now TLS Protect Datacenter (TLSPDC) and VaaS is now TLS Protect Cloud (TLSPC).  All functions have been renamed to prefix with `-Vdc` (Venafi Datacenter) or `-Vc` (Venafi Cloud).  Combined platform functions, those prefixed with `-Venafi`, have all been updated to dedicated platform functions.  The desire to add additional functionality for each platform and reduce parameter set complexity drove this decision.  The only exception to this rule are the functions related to the session.  Aliases have been added where applicable.
- VenafiPS is now signed.  `Test-ModuleHash` has been deprecated.
- VenafiSession is stored for nested operations each time a function is called directly.  This has 2 main benefits:
   - Performance enhancement bypassing `Test-VenafiSession` in nested functions
   - No longer need to pass VenafiSession to each function when sending function output down the pipeline
 - Parallel functionality added for many functions, notably export and import certificates.  Ensure you are using PowerShell v7!
 - Add Certificate, Key, and Chain PEM to `Export-VdcCertificate` and `Export-VcCertificate` Base64 output
 - For PSCredential objects which only required a password and not username, add the ability to provide either a password String, SecureString, or PSCredential.
 - `Find-VaasObject` has been replaced with dedicated functions `Find-VcCertificateRequest`, `Find-VcLog`, `Find-VcMachine`, and `Find-VcMachineIdentity`.  These functions have property filters specific to their types making it super easy to search.
 - Environment variable names updated:
  - TPP_SERVER -> VDC_SERVER
  - TPP_TOKEN -> VDC_TOKEN
  - VAAS_KEY -> VC_KEY
 - Add keystore/private key import to `Import-VcCertificate`
 - Update `Invoke-VenafiParallel` to be version aware.  Parallel on PowerShell v7+, synchronous otherwise
 - Add option to save .crt/.key with `Export-VdcCertificate` , [#226](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/226)
 - Update TLSPC searching to make -Order case insensitive
 - Fix `Get-TppAttribute -Disabled` not working, [#221](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/221)
 - Fix exporting JKS to a file, [#225](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/225)
 - Add option to save exported certificate and key to separate files, [#226](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/226)
 - `Revoke-TppCertificate` deprecated, use `Invoke-VdcCertificateAction -Revoke`
 - Dedicated removal functions created for TLSPC
 - Add filters `-IsSelfSigned` and `-IsWildcard` to `Find-VdcCertificate`
 - CodeSign Protect functions have been deprecated


## 5.8.1
- Remove deprecated application server types from `New-VaasCertificate`

## 5.8.0
- Add `Find-VaasMachine` to find machines by type or status.  The list of attributes to search by will increase over time.  `Find-VaasObject -Type Machine` can always be used as well.
- Add `Get-VaasMachine` to get machines by uuid, name, or get all.
- Update `Invoke-VaasWorkflow` output to include workflow id (wsClientId)
- Add machine creation functions `New-VaasMachine`, `New-VaasMachineIis`, and `New-VaasMachineCommonKeystore`.  These require PowerShell v7+ and have parallel processing.  `New-VaasMachine` is for basic machines with hostname, credential, and optional port, eg. Citrix and F5.
- Add machine types to $VenafiSession.MachineTypes when using `New-VenafiSession` for VaaS
- Add `Invoke-VenafiParallel` private function to easily execute operations in parallel.  Requires PowerShell v7+.
- Add argument completer to `New-VaasMachine -MachineType` and `Find-VaasMachine -MachineType` for dynamic tab-ahead list of machine types
- Add [PSSodium](https://github.com/TylerLeonhardt/PSSodium) as a nested module, required for machine creation functions

## 5.7.0
- Add `Find-VenafiCertificate -SavedSearchName` to find VaaS certificate details via an existing saved search filter
- Add `Get-VaasSatellite` to retrieve vsatellite details optionally including encryption key and algorithm
- Add `Set-VaasCertificateAssignment` to add or replace applications associated to certificates
- Add User property to `$VenafiSession` when connecting to VaaS.  All kinds of helpful info here including company ID.
- Fix credentials not being written to the vault with `New-VenafiSession -VaultVaasKeyName`


## 5.6.0
- Add specific error messages when a TPP token scope/privilege is not sufficient for the current function.  The message will include both the current and missing scope/privilege, [#175](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/175).
- Add `Set-VaasTeam` to update existing VaaS teams. You can update the name, role, and/or user matching rules. User matching rules can be overwritten or appended to.
- Add `Remove-VaasObject` to remove a VaaS team, application, machine, machine identity, tag, or connector.
- Remove `TppObject` class. This was causing issues for some who aren't familiar with the Using keyword and differences between it and import-module when it comes to classes.
- Add `Invoke-VaasWorkflow` to trigger either a Test, Provision, or Discover machine/machine identity workflow. As one example, this is super helpful when looking to automate renewal and provisioning of certificates that may expire soon.

## 5.5.1
- Fix error with `Get-TppPermission` when an identity which had been permissioned has had its account deleted.  Explicit permissions will be returned, but the identity path and name will be null as we can no longer look it up from the provider.
- `Get-TppPermission -Attribute` has been deprecated.  Identity path and name are included in the return object.  For other attributes, use `Get-TppIdentityAttribute`.


## 5.5.0
- Add `Set-TppAttribute -NoOverwrite` to allow additions to an attribute list.  [#189](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/189)
- Add `Get-TppAttribute -NoLookup` for the remote cases where a built-in attribute and custom field have the same name.  The default will be to look for a custom field.  Use `-NoLookup` to override.  [#192](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/192)
- Add ability to export the chain on VaaS with `Export-VenafiCertificate`
- Add ability to export a certificate to a file on VaaS with `Export-VenafiCertificate`
- Fix certain characters in friendly name causing `Test-TppIdentityFormat` to fail, [#205](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/205)
- Add ability to set specific permission with `Set-TppPermission` and not just an entire permissions object, [#197](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/197)
- Enhance pipeline support for `Set-TppPermission`
- Fix failure removing a custom field value with `Set-TppAttribute`, [#199](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/199)
- Fix `ConvertTo-TppFullPath` appending '\ved\policy' incorrectly on non-Windows environments

## 5.4.1
- Add support for JWT token authentication in `New-VenafiSession` and `New-TppToken`

## 5.4.0
- Add 'all' token scope with 2 values, 'core' and 'admin'.  'Core' is all scopes except for admin and 'admin' includes admin.  Use as `New-VenafiSession -Scope @{'all'='core'}`.  Not suggested for production environments
- Add `-SkipCertificateCheck` to `New-VenafiSession` and `New-TppToken` to bypass certificate checking, useful in pre-production environments, connecting via IP, etc.  If you aren't creating a new session, but providing a token directly to a function, the same functionality can be found by setting an environment variable `$env:VENAFIPS_SKIP_CERT_CHECK=1`.  If vaulting your token, this value will also be vaulted in the metadata making it very easy to use `New-VenafiSession -VaultRefreshAccessToken $name` and connect to pre-prod environments with no certificate checking
- `New-VenafiSession -VaultMetadata` is now deprecated and metadata will be vaulted by default
- Token scope is now vaulted in metadata and added to $VenafiSession when using `-VaultAccessTokenName` or `-VaultRefreshTokenName` of `New-VenafiSession`
- Update `Write-VerboseWithSecret` to support secrets in delimited json
- Fix TppObject ParentPath error when it contains certain characters, [#186](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/186)
- Fix object does not exist error with `Move-TppObject` in a try/catch, [#185](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/185)


## 5.3.1
- Fix `Get-TppClassAttribute -All` error when providing VenafiSession directly, [#182](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/182)


## 5.3.0
- Add `Remove-TppObject` to remove any object.  Multiple people have asked for this so it's been added, but be careful using it as it can be very destructive.  Recommend using -WhatIf to validate.
- Fix `Invoke-VenafiCertificateAction` always running as verbose, [#173](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/173)
- Fix `Set-TppAttribute` error when providing a null value, [#176](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/176)
- Fix `Set-TppPermission` error when providing VenafiSession directly, [#174](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/174)


## 5.2.2
- Add specific event webhook subscription, not just types, and criticality option to `New-VaasConnector`
- Fix `Get-TppObject` returning invalid parent path, [#166](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/166)
- Fix `Get-VenafiCertificate -All` not paging through all results, [#164](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/164)
- Update `Remove-TppCertificate` and `Remove-TppCertificateAssociation` to align with latest `Get-TppAttribute` changes, [#168](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/168)


## 5.2.1
- Fix `Set-TppAttribute` not setting integer values, [#145](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/145)

## 5.0.0
- Rewrite Get-TppAttribute
  - Greatly simplified with far less parameters needed
  - Attributes, which have values, available as properties at the root level in the response.  This is useful for direct value access.
  - A property named `Attribute` has been added with all attribute names, values, and configuration.  This is useful for looping over the attributes, determining where a policy attribute is set, and more.
- Add TPP engine management functions `Add-TppEngineFolder`, `Find-TppEngine`, `Get-TppEngineFolder`, and `Remove-TppEngineFolder`.  Thanks [@ccamacho1966](https://github.com/ccamacho1966)!

- Add `Import-VaasCertificate`.  Export from TPP right into VaaS (and vice versa).
- `Import-TppCertificate` updates
   - Add pipelining with either `-CertificatePath` or `CertificateData`.  You can provide FileInfo objects or just an array of paths.
   - If using PS v6+, import will now use parallel processing.  Control the number of certificates imported at once with the new parameter `-ThrottleLimit`.  This is definitely the recommended approach for bulk importing.
   - Add prepending '\ved\policy' to `-PolicyPath` if not provided
 - `Get-TppAttribute` updates
   - `-Attribute` can now accept custom field labels/names to retrieve the value, [#74](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/74)
   - Return Locked and Overridden values where applicable
   - Notify user when attribute name provided to `-Attribute` is not valid
 - Fix SecretManagement module existence check not always being triggered in `New-VenafiSession`, [#123](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/123)

 - Allow any attribute names for `Get-TppIdentityAttribute -Attribute`, [#125](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/125)


## 4.5.0
- Add docker image with each new build and [publish to dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/venafi/venafips-module).  Add the below environment variables recognition for use with docker image, but could be used outside of it as well.  This is great for ci/cd scenarios and more.
  - TPP_SERVER - TPP server url
  - TPP_TOKEN - TPP oauth token
  - VAAS_KEY - VaaS key
- Fix `Set-TppAttribute` not clearing a value.  You can now pass $null to clear an object's attribute value, [#119](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/119)

- Deprecate `Get-VaasOrgUnit` as it's being deprecated by VaaS


## 4.3.0
- Add new output format for `Get-TppAttribute` using the parameter `-New`.  Attributes will now be provided as object properties as opposed to individual objects for each property, which made it difficult to retrieve the value itself.  This new format is available for all ways of using the function including attribute, effective attribute, and policy retrieval.  This new format will become the default in the future.
- Add `Get-TppAttribute -PolicyClass -All` to retrieve all policy attributes at once

- Fix `Move-TppObject` not appending object name when moving multiple objects to a new folder and passed via pipeline
- Update `Find-TppObject` to allow passing of empty string for `-Pattern` to find objects which don't have a value set


## 4.2.3
- Fix certain aliases not being exported

## 4.2.2
- Add authentication options, VaaS key or TPP token, in addition to VenafiSession to be provided directly to any function that supports that platform.  This better enables devops scenarios so 1 call can be made for a function as opposed to executing New-VenafiSession first.  Note, if using this with TPP, an environment variable named TppServer with the url of the server must be set.
- Add `Test-VenafiSession` private function to add support for the new authentication methods as VenafiSession.Validate isn't used.  `Invoke-VenafiRestMethod` has been updated to accept these new authentication methods as well.
- Add option to export from VaaS in JKS format
- Migrate docs site to Material theme

## 4.2.1

- Add `Remove-VenafiTeamOwner` to remove a team owner, VaaS and TPP
- Add `ConvertTo-TppIdentity` to standardize TPP identity objects
- Add `Get-VenafiIdentity` to retrieve a specific identity, the current user, or all, VaaS and TPP.  This replaces `Get-TppIdentity`.  The ability to retrieve associated identities and group members has been extended to `-All`.
- Change `Invoke-TppRestMethod` to `Invoke-VenafiRestMethod` in remaining internal module calls
- Move key/token refresh messaging to TPP only in `VenafiSession` as no refresh for VaaS
