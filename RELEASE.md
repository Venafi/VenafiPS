- Add support for token refresh to `New-TppToken`.  Auto-refresh VenafiSession when token expires and we have a refresh token.  [#33](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiPS/issues/33)
- Fix invalid grant details in `Test-TppToken`, [#32](https://github.com/gdbarron/VenafiPS/issues/32)
- Update Version in VenafiSession object, from `Get-TppVersion`, to be of type Version.  Drop Revision from version so now only 3 octets.  This assists in performing version validation.
- Update `New-TppToken` to account for a bug in pre 21.3 which expected the client_id to be lowercase
- Update `Test-TppToken` to validate the tpp version is supported
