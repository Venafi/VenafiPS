- Merge all functions into 1 psm1 module.  This yields much better performance, especially when running multithreaded.
- Add multithreading support on PS v5 with the Microsoft.PowerShell.ThreadJob module (installed separately).  If the module isn't installed, multithreading will be disabled.  Set `-ThrottleLimit` to 1 on the functions that support it to disable multithreading on PS v5 and v7.
- Module now available in the GitHub release.  This is helpful for those without access to PowerShell Gallery, although that is the preferred option.
- PSSodium, needed for several TLSPC functions for encryption, is no longer directly included in the module.  Install it from the Gallery.
- The VenafiSession class has been deprecated and replaced with a PSCustomObject equivalent
- Key based authentication on TLSPDC has been deprecated
- Default `Invoke-VdcCertificateAction -Push` to push to all applications and added an example to override and push to specific applications
