- Add token based authentication to VC with `New-VenafiSession -VcEndpoint` and `New-VcToken`.  If the JWT has not expired, but the access token has, `New-VcToken` supports refresh.
- Caching framework created for many VC objects (and some VDC ones as well).  If a requested item is not found, the cache will try and refresh in case it's been newly created.
- Enhanced tab completion now utilizing the new caching framework.  A lot more objects are now available via tab completion and will also display a description as well.  For example, VSatellite shows the status and version.  Be sure to set your Tab key functionality with `Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete`
- Add many direct filters to `Find-VcLog` and `Find-VcCertificateRequest` so -Filter can be used less (since it's cumbersome).  The other Find functions will get similar treatment in time.  If you have specific filters you'd like to add, please submit an enhancement request
- Add `Find-Vc* -IncludeAny` to OR the direct filters as opposed to AND
- Add `Find-VdcCertificate -Algorithm` to support the new pkix algorithms introduced in v25.1.  Tab completion is available with full descriptions.  `New-VdcCertificate` and other applicable functions will be updated in time
- All current VC regions have been added
- Add support for VC shared credentials with `New-VcMachine -Credential`, `New-VcMachineCommonKeystore -Credential`, and `New-VcMachineIis -Credential`, [#349](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/349)
- Fix `Invoke-VcWorkflow` test connection where the configured size of the socket response was not large enough
- Fix `Invoke-VcCertificateAction` error when the certificate was not issued within the VC timeout
- Add `Invoke-VcCertificateAction -Renew -Wait` to monitor a renewal for passing the requested state
