- Add support for tags during certificate creation with `New-VcCertificate -Tag`, [#337](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/337)
- Performance enhancement for `ConvertTo-VdcObject` which decreased Windows Powershell runtimes for `Find-VdcObject` and all other functions that use it, [#342](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/342)
- Add `-IsExpired:$false` for both `Find-VdcCertificate` and `Find-VcCertificate` to find all certificates that are not expired
- Add renewal configuration to `Get-VcApplication`
- Fix issue with `Invoke-VcWorkflow` where $VenafiSession was not getting picked up properly
- Ensure only 1 team matches Owner when using `New-VcMachine -Owner` and the value is a name.  This is needed as the product allows multiple teams with the same name.
- Create duplicate objects with `New-VdcObject -SourcePath`.  **Not recommended for certificates**.  [#343](https://github.com/Venafi/VenafiPS/issues/343)
- Allow manifests of different formats to be provided to `Set-VcConnector`
